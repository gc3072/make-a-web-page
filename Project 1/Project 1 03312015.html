                    HTML is made of:<br>
                    - Text content (<em>What you see</em>)<br>
                    - Markup (<em>What it looks like</em>)<br>
                    - References to other documents (<em>eg- videos and images</em>)<br>
                    - Links to other pages (<em>URLs</em>)<br>

                    These HTML docs are grouped together or linked by URLs. (Uniform Resource Locator)
                    These are known as the global addresses of documents and other resources in the World Wide Web.Some examples of the types of files that can be found on the web are:

                     - Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (&lt;p&gt; for example) and a closing tag, (&lt;/p&gt;). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the &lt;br&gt; tag).<br>
                     <br>
        
                     - Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags. There are examples of inline tags and block tags. You can use these to manage whitespace. Inline tags just creates space around that line and does not do much else like creates a new line for text. Block creates whitespace around the content so there will be differences in how that text is displayed by the browser.<br>

                     A website is much like your house. HTML is where your walls are placed. Which room is your kitchen or bedroom. CSS is the style of your house. What color are the walls, what furniture is in each room. Javascript would be something that changes an element in your house. Your TV remote changes channels on the TV or your garage door opener open and closes the garage.
                     </p>

                     <p>
                     There are basic rules to how things behave in HTML, just like there are rules for your house. The TV does not float; it is attached to a wall or on a stand. Tools are used to interpret HTML. We can look at HTML as a tree like structure where elements branch out and can continue to branch. Much like a family tree from your Grandmother, to your Mother, to you, and so on… 
                     </p>

                     <p>
                     HTML is the structure of your webpage. It is a document. HTML uses tags which form elements that create this tree structure. It knows how to do this based on DOM. (DOM- Document Object Model) Wiki defines DOM as a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML and other Mark-up languages. When you hear a developer speak about DOM, they are referring to the modeled tree-like structure of the document.
                     </p>
                     <br>
                             CSS – Cascading Style Sheets- is another language used for designing a webpage. CSS will control the style of the webpage. Basically, how does the webpage look?

                     <p>
                     Using boxes to organize your information on your webpage allows you the ability to code each piece of your webpage and apply designs, positioning, and style to your document elements you created with HTML using CSS. You can have boxes within boxes, so it is a good idea to start with the larger boxes and work down to the smaller ones when you are designing a webpage layout.

                  <p>
                  There are three ways you can do this:
                  <br>
                  <h5>Method 1: write CSS in the &lt; head &gt; of your HTML</h5>
                  <br>
                  This method is good for very small projects (like what you'd do in scratchpad.io). To do this: 
                  <br>
                  1. At the top of your HTML document, add a &lt; head &gt; element. 
                  <br>
                  2. Inside the &lt; head &gt; element, add a &lt; style &gt; element.
                  <br> 
                  3. Write your CSS in the &lt; style &gt; element and then put the HTML for the rest of your page below.
                  <br>

                  
                  <h5>Method 2: Link your HTML to a separate CSS file</h5>

                  <br>
                  This adds another step, but it lets you stay more organized when working on larger projects. To do this:
                  <br>
                  1. Write all of your structural HTML in one file (let's call it main.html).
                  <br>
                  2. In a separate file (let's call it main.css), put all of your CSS code.
                  <br> 
                  3. Add a &lt; head &gt; element to the top of your HTML.
                  <br> 
                  4. Add a &lt; link &gt; tag inside the &lt; head &gt; element. Since &lt; link &gt; is a "void tag" you don't need to add a closing &lt; /link &gt;.
                  <br> 
                  5. Add the following attributes to your &lt; link &gt;: * rel="stylesheet" * type="text/css" * href="main.css"
                  <br>

                  <h5>Method 3: Write your style inline with your HTML</h5>
                  

                  <br>
                  This is generally a very bad idea because it leads to lots of repeated code. But you may see code that uses this method so it's good to be familiar with it. If you want to know more, check out the question and answers in this conversation on Stack Overflow (Stack Overflow is the most widely used programming Q&amp;A community out there). With this method, you modify the style attributes of every individual HTML element.

                 <p>

                 There are four main points that Jessica addressed about box sizing:
                 <br>
                 1.HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.
                 <br>
                 2.Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.
                 <br>
                 3.There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues.
                 <br>
                 a.Set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels.
                 <br>
                 b.Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element. 
                 <br>
                 {
                  -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
                  -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
                  -ms-box-sizing: border-box;
                  box-sizing: border-box;
                 } 
                 <br>
                 4.Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently.
                 <br>
                 </p>
                 </div>

                 <p>

                 1.Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.
                 <br>
                 2.Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.
